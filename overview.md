# planet

Feral/Death world

Almost completly covered in dense forrest

# Early History

3 craft headed towards Clach Nadair, one for settlers, one with the STCs needed for survival and re-equipment, and one for the Adepta Sororitas that were designated to protect the world

in the warp the craft with the Sororitas are blown off cource, and end up on a totally different planet, here they get emboiled in a war with marauding Orks, and are depleted to the ppoint they can no longer support their origional mission

survey ships are sent to Clach Nadair to look for survivors, but this process is lost to the anels of time and Administratum burocracy, the Sororitas are sent on more pressing matters, and <planet> is forgotten by the imperium

on the planet, things don't go much better, with no protection from the Sororitas the temporoay habitats of the settlers are set upon by the creatures of the world, and in a matter of years most of the equipment is damaged beyond repair

the STCs land in a location where the forrest is particularly dence with folliage, and are burried benieth a mound of plantlife

but this was not the end for the settlers, now bereft of their homes they were forced into the forrests, and fractured into smaller societies, such so they could escape the wrath of the creatures of the forrests

formed into smaller groups, with no central settlements, the settlers entered an uneasy time, many perished, but those that survived came to form a bond with the forests around them, learning not to see nature as the aggressor, but rarther themselves. This became a turning point where instead of trying to attack the forrest, the settlers came to nurture, and eventually protect the forests

# Societal Structure

the general structure of a Nadair tribe is matriarchal, in fact, in the various villages no men can be found at all

## Family Life

there are no families, all Nigheanan belong to the tribe, and the tribe to the Nigheanan

the women of the tribe will call their elders "Mathair" or Mother, their peers "Piuthar" or Sister, and those younger than them as "Nighean" or Daughter

## The role of men

men of Nadair are seen from outsiders as outcasts, but in Nadair society they play an important role

Nadair men do not belong to a tribe, as the women to, but instead take the title ot "Uard", or ward, and live in the forrests between the tribal villages, often sheparding the creatures of the forest away from the villages

they hold no aliegance, not even to their birth village, and so will often wander far and wide, never calling any place home, as all places are their home

## Deas-ghn√†th - the rite of passage

when a girl becomes 15 she is sent into the forrest, and must kill a "Fiacail", a big feline type creature with sabre tooth fangs

if she is able to kill the Fiacail and return to the village with its tooth as proof, she is welcomed as a Eun and can re-join the tribe

if she fails however there are 2 outcomes. one is death, the kinder of the two outcomes, for if one is able to survive in the forrest, but not defeat a Fiacail, they become Taibhse

## Taibhse

the fate of those that shirk the way of the warrior, 

their skin slowly turns to bark making movement harder and harder as the days go by, eventually immobilising them completly,

their insides rot away, until all that is left is the soul, forever trapped in bark, but this is not the end

becoming one with the forrest, the souls of the Taibhse re-ignite in their former bodies-turned-bark, and they are born again, the bark becoming willowy and supple, allowing them to move with an unusual grace

but all sence of their former self is lost in the process, becomeing little more than beasts, they are pitied by the Eun and Uard alike, but become and embodimnent of the forest itself, and will defent it with virdent ferver should it ever come under attack

## Mating

of cource, for the continuation of any society there needs to be ever new generations born, and the the Nadair are no different

although Nadair males are forbidden from entering the villages under normal circumstances, under the light of the moon on the darkest day, a primal urge leads these men into the villages

the Eun themselves are only permitted to become mothers after already commiting great deeds in their life, and on these nights will take for themselves the men that return, such that the newborns are welcomed into the world on the comeing summer

after this ritual mating, the men will take any boys that have reached 10 years away from the villages, and take other the teaching such that they themselves will become Uard, there is no ceromony like that for the Eun, as they take on the responsibility to wander the forests for the rest of their lives

## Early life 
due to mating taking place on the same day, the newborns are similarly expected around the same time, and after only a brief period of recovery the Eun mothers return to their roles within the tribe, having no ties to the newborn

the children are then cared for by Eun who's role is the care of these newborn, collectivly they are the Nighean (daugher) to all in the tribe.

as soon as they are able to hold a spear the training begins, this can be seen as harsh by oursiders as the training is intense and nonforgiving, but this is in preparation for the Deas-ghnath, or for boys training for their life as a Uard, and is seen as a nessesty.

oftentimes this leads to a comradry between the girls that is stronger than that of themselves to their elders, thus "Piuthar" are seen as almost a family unit unto themselves, and this continues into adulthood
